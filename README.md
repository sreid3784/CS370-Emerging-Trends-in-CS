# CS370-Emerging-Trends-in-CS
Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

This project, for me, was very challenging and I owe my solution to gaut2172. The code allowed me the oppurtunity to be able to see this model in action and learn more about Q-learning. Interestingly enough, I never did see an output in the form of a visual path the agent followed, which I thought was odd. I never did solve for that and hope to one day understand why it wouldn't function as intended. Beside that, we were given the code for the environt, the experience replay, the code to build the model, and the code needed for the game to be played. We were given a skeleton for the Q-training algorithm which I finished using gaut2172's solution. 

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists find computational solutions to problems and build solutions through programs. We seek to understand a way to solve a problem that is repeatable and something that can be shared with the world. We also ensure ethical standards are met. This matters because often times people struggle with the same problem but not everyone solves them the same way. Computer scientist seek to offer solutions to people that work for everyone and make the world better. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I approach problems as a computer scientist by taking things, turning them into requirements, building diagrams, and eventually coding a viable solution to the problem. I am also open to other contributions and willingly share with the world and collaborate with others. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilites to the end user are to protect their information, and create problems that do have harmful consequences. It is also to be transparent in my design. This is crucially important in the world of AI where the "how" isn't always researchable, especially in the case of blackbox AI solutions.
